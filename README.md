## Tools Used

The following security tools were used to conduct the analysis:

- **[MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)**: A framework for static and dynamic analysis of mobile applications.
- **[APKTool](https://apktool.org/)**: A tool for decompiling and modifying APK files.
- **[Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)**: A tool for obtaining root privileges in a safe and reversible manner.
- **[Android Studio (Emulator)](https://developer.android.com/studio)**: A testing environment for Android applications.
- **[Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)**: A tool for analyzing network traffic.
- **[Drozer](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer)**: A framework for analyzing vulnerabilities in Android components.

## Methodology

The application analysis was conducted following these steps:

1. **APK Download**
2. **Static Analysis**: Decompiling and verifying the security of the code, configurations, and dependencies.
3. **Dynamic Analysis**: Testing on an emulated device with network traffic monitoring tools and vulnerability verification.
4. **Identification and Contextualization of Vulnerabilities**: Classifying security issues and possible mitigations.
